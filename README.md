# BaSys 4.2 P4P-Demonstrator
This project constitutes a set of control component and service implementations 
for Industrie 4.0 components located at the DFKI MRK4.0 Lab as part of [Power4Production](https://power4production.de/) 
along with associated configurations (asset administration shells, control component server, platform) of BaSys 4.2.
## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine in an Eclipse IDE for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

1) Install the BaSys 4.2  Workbench including this project. To this end, follow these instructions: [Eclipse integration](https://basys.dfki.dev/gitlab/i40/basys/eclipse-integration).

2) Install the BaSys 4.2 docker stacks as described [here](https://basys.dfki.dev/gitlab/i40/basys/docker). Note: Regarding the dockerized demonstration environment, make sure that running containers
do not interfere with your workbench setup, i.e. simply stop the BaSys-related containers for Administration Shell Management, Control Components, and the BaSys service platform.

### Overview
Once you have sucessfully setup the project in your Eclipse IDE, you will find sub-projects therein configuring
- Asset administration shell management (aas)
- Control Component Server (ccs)
- BaSys 4.2 service platform (platform)

## Configuration
### Asset Administration Shell Management (aas)
Here, you define the asset administration shells and associated submodels of I40 components
which will be accessible via the AAS registry under `localhost:4999/api/v1/registry`. The
following folders (visible in the Eclipse Package Explorer) are of importance:

- `components`: Includes a set of `.properties/.json`-files for asset administration shells (`aas` subfolder) and
                associated submodels (`submodels`)
- `components_repo`: Set of pre-configured aas and submodels which can be used in the `components` folder

### Control Component Server (ccs)
In this project, control components for which an instance is automatically generated in the OPC-UA server (`opc.tcp://localhost:12685/basys`)
are specified. The following folders are of importance:
- `certs`: Set of trusted, rejected and issued certificates of OPC-UA clients for accessing the OPC-UA server
- `components`: Set of `.properties/.json`-files configuring important properties of an asset such as its id, name, execution mode, ids of aas/submodels and service endpoints
- `components_repo`: Set of pre-defined control-component configs which can be used in the `components` folder

### BaSys Service Platform (platform)
Here, you configure important service components of the BaSys Service platform. Important folders:
- `components`: in the `services` subfolder, you find important service configurations, i.e. for the process execution manager and the  mqtt gateway
- `components_repo`: set of pre-defined configs which can be used in the `components` folder 
- `processes`: set of production and test processes in `.bpmn` format

## Usage
### Starting the P4P-Demonstrator 
In order to start the P4P-Demonstrator from within the Eclipse IDE for testing purposes proceed as follows.
Each subproject (aas, ccs, platform) provides an own `.launch` file which can be started via `Right-Click --> Run As`.
Start all three of them in the following order: 
1) aas
2) ccs
3) platform

After a first launch, the three mentioned run configurations should appear in the run section.

### Inspecting the OPC-UA Server
You can use for example [Prosys OPC UA Client](https://downloads.prosysopc.com/opc-ua-client-downloads.php) for
inspecting the Basys OPC UA Server (`opc.tcp://localhost:12685/basys`). Your first attempt for a login will
probably fail since a new certificate for your client will be generated on the server side and initially rejected.
You will find it in the corresponding folders of the ccs as mentioned above. Just move the newly generated certificate
for your client from the `rejected` folder under `certs` into the `trusted` folder. 

Here is an example for five configured assets in the control component server project which result in 
a corresponding information tree in the OPC-UA server.

Under each parent node of an asset you will find the corresponding control component object along with 
registered operation modes (which you can also trigger from here) and status variables.

### Starting Processes
With a running asset administration shell management, control component server, BaSys service platform and
3rd party service docker stack (backend) you will be able to execute production and test processes previously deployed 
 via the [Camunda Modeler](https://camunda.com/de/download/modeler/) to the camunda REST endpoint (http://localhost:9080/engine-rest).
To this end, you can use the web-based camunda frontend (`http://localhost:9080/camunda/`) directly or the [ppr-dashboard](https://mrk40.dfki.de/mrk-4.0/ppr-dashboard).
