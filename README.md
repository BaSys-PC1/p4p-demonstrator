# BaSys 4.2 P4P-Demonstrator
This project constitutes a set of control component and service implementations 
for Industrie 4.0 components located at the DFKI MRK4.0 Lab as part of [Power4Producation](https://power4production.de/) 
along with associated configurations (asset administration shells, control component server, platform) of BaSys 4.2.
## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine in an Eclipse IDE for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

1) Install the BaSys 4.2  Workbench including this project. To this end, follow these instructions: [Eclipse integration](https://basys.dfki.dev/gitlab/i40/basys/eclipse-integration).

2) Install the BaSys 4.2 docker stacks as described [here](https://basys.dfki.dev/gitlab/i40/basys/docker). Note: Regarding the dockerized demonstration environment, make sure that running containers
do not interfere with your workbench setup, i.e. simply stop the BaSys-related containers for Administration Shell Management, Control Components, and the BaSys service platform.
