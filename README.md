# BaSys 4.2 P4P-Demonstrator
This project constitutes a set of control component and service implementations 
for Industrie 4.0 components located at the DFKI MRK4.0 Lab as part of [Power4Production](https://power4production.de/) 
along with associated configurations (asset administration shells, control component server, platform) of BaSys 4.2.
## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine in an Eclipse IDE for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

1) Install the BaSys 4.2  Workbench including this project. To this end, follow these instructions: [Eclipse integration](https://basys.dfki.dev/gitlab/i40/basys/eclipse-integration).

2) Install the BaSys 4.2 docker stacks as described [here](https://basys.dfki.dev/gitlab/i40/basys/docker). Note: Regarding the dockerized demonstration environment, make sure that running containers
do not interfere with your workbench setup, i.e. simply stop the BaSys-related containers for Administration Shell Management, Control Components, and the BaSys service platform.

### Overview
Once you have sucessfully setup the project in your Eclipse IDE, you will find sub-projects therein configuring
- Asset administration shell management (aas)
- Control Component Server (ccs)
- BaSys 4.2 service platform (platform)

## Usage
### Configuration
#### Asset Administration Shell Management (aas)
Here, you define the asset administration shells and associated submodels of I40 components
which will be accessible via the AAS registry under `localhost:4999/api/v1/registry`. The
following folders (visible in the Eclipse Package Explorer) are of importance:

- `components`: Includes a set of `.properties`-files for asset administration shells (`aas` subfolder) and
                associated submodels (`submodels`)
- `components_repo`: Set of pre-configured aas and submodels which can be used in the `components` folder
